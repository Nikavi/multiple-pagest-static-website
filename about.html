    History and variants of kanelbunle
    <br />
    The early history of the cinnamon roll is uncertain. In the United States , cinnamon buns are a common breakfast
    food .
    Sweet and sticky Philadelphia -style cinnamon buns originated in the 18th century and contain honey , sugar,
    cinnamon,
    and raisins . There are also many other variants, such as the Swedish which has spread globally.
    <br />
    In Sweden, there is evidence of wheat bread called "cinnamon bun" since at least the 1850s. The variant that
    was later called cinnamon bun was probably created in Sweden in the 1920s , when the availability of the
    ingredients increased after the First World War . However, it took until the 1950s before the cinnamon bun became
    common in Sweden.
    <br />
    The Swedish cinnamon roll is less sweet and not as powerful as American varieties. Another difference
    is that the Swedish cinnamon roll often contains cardamom .
